# fbGraph
A Plugin for moziloCMS 2.0

Reads the facebook graph and returns specific information.

**Attention:** This plugin is no longer working, since facebook updated it's graph API to version 2, where unauthorized access is no longer possible without an API token.

## Installation
#### With moziloCMS installer
To add (or update) a plugin in moziloCMS, go to the backend tab *Plugins* and click the item *Manage Plugins*. Here you can choose the plugin archive file (note that it has to be a ZIP file with exactly the same name the plugin has) and click *Install*. Now the fbGraph plugin is listed below and can be activated.

#### Manually

- Go to the backend tab *Plugins* and activate the now listed new fbGraph plugin
